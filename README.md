# Rozerofo
*Font for Romoji in Re:ZERO*

![v0.6](https://github.com/flyingfeather1501/font-rozerofo/raw/master/preview/v0.6.png)

## Assumption

I'm assuming that this script is Ro because:

- i, ro, ha is 1, 2, 3 in the I-Ro-Ha sorting system [Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D%E3%81%AF%E9%A0%86)
- I-script-only is the kiddie way of writing (like Kana-only Japanese), suggesting a Kanji equivalent
- this one is used in government posters (episode 14)
- it's hard to imagine anything in between the I script and this one.

## Writing Systems in Lugnica

According to Ram, there are three writing systems in Lugnica:

- I (casual, children's books are written in it)
- Ro (formal)
- Ha (formal)

As taida5656 has decoded, the I script corresponds to modern Kana, and the assumed Ro script corresponds to English alphabet.
